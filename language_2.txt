the wind blew gently through the fields 
stretching endlessly toward the horizon where the sky met the earth in a seamless line the grass swayed like a sea of green and yellow as the sun dipped low casting long shadows that seemed to stretch with time itself in the distance a lone figure could be seen walking slowly along a narrow path worn smooth by countless footsteps this figure was a traveler someone who had wandered through many lands seen many sights but always felt a pull toward something unknown something just out of reach with every 
tep the traveler took toward the horizon the air 
seemed to grow heavier as though the land itself held its breath waiting for something to unfold
the traveler s name was ilian and though he had journeyed far and wide through deserts and mountains across rivers and 
forests he had never found the answers he sought he had heard stories from those he met of a place where time stood still where the 
past and future intertwined and where one could glimpse the true nature of the universe this place was spoken of only in whispers and ilian 
s heart was set on finding it he believed it was real hidden somewhere beyond the world he knew somewhere on the edge of reality itsel
for days ilian walked through the vast plains beneath the open sky as clouds drifted lazily overhead he was guided only by his instincts 
and the faint pull of an unseen force that tugged at him when the sun began to set on the fourth day he came upon a small clearing and saw before him an ancient oak tree its branches wide and gnarled reaching out like hands toward the heavens it was unlike any tree he had ever seen before its bark was silvered and smooth as though polished by centuries of wind and rain and its roots seemed to twist and turn deep into the earth as though they held the secrets of the world within them
illian approached the tree his feet quiet against the earth as if not to disturb the stillness of the moment he reached out and touched the 
trunk of the tree and in that instant the world seemed to fall away the air grew thick with energy and the ground beneath him trembled as though 
something vast and ancient was awakening from a long slumber
